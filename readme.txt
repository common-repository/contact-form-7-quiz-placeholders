== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this for? =

Contact Form 7 features a "Watermark" option, which displays the field's label inside the input area instead of outside of it. The watermark feature works great, but is missing for quizzes. Converting the quiz labels to placeholders automatically fills this void.
